  Abstract                 = {The ability for muscle to repeatedly generate force is limited by fatigue. The cellular mechanisms behind muscle fatigue are complex and potentially include breakdown at many points along the excitation–contraction pathway. In this paper we construct a mathematical model of the skeletal muscle excitation–contraction pathway based on the cellular biochemical events that link excitation to contraction. The model includes descriptions of membrane voltage, calcium cycling and crossbridge dynamics and was parameterised and validated using the response characteristics of mouse skeletal muscle to a range of electrical stimuli. This model was used to uncover the complexities of skeletal muscle fatigue. We also parameterised our model to describe force kinetics in fast and slow twitch fibre types, which have a number of biochemical and biophysical differences. How these differences interact to generate different force/fatigue responses in fast- and slow- twitch fibres is not well understood and we used our modelling approach to bring new insights to this relationship.},

Traditional rasterization-based visualization approaches encounter performance and quality limitations, particularly in HPC environments without dedicated rendering hardware. In this paper, we present OSPRay, a turn-key CPU ray tracing framework oriented towards production-use scientific visualization which can utilize varying SIMD widths and multiple device backends found across diverse HPC resources. This framework provides a high-quality, efficient CPU-based solution for typical visualization workloads, which has already been integrated into several prevalent visualization packages. We show that this system delivers the performance, high-level API simplicity, and modular device support needed to provide a compelling new rendering framework for implementing efficient scientific visualization workflows.},

	abstract = {Visualization applications nowadays not only face increasingly larger datasets, but have to solve increasingly complex research questions. They often require more than a single algorithm and consequently a software solution will exceed the possibilities of simple research prototypes. Well-established systems intended for such complex visual analysis purposes have usually been designed for classical, mesh-based graphics approaches. For particle-based data, however, existing visualization frameworks are too generic - e.g. lacking possibilities for consistent low-level GPU optimization for high-performance graphics - and at the same time are too limited - e.g. by enforcing the use of structures suboptimal for some computations. Thus, we developed the system softwareMegaMol for visualization research on particle-based data. On the one hand, flexible data structures and functional module design allow for easy adaption to changing research questions, e.g. studying vapors in thermodynamics, solid material in physics, or complex functional macromolecules like proteins in biochemistry. Therefore, MegaMol is designed as a development framework. On the other hand, common functionality for data handling and advanced rendering implementations are available and beneficial for all applications. We present several case studies of work implemented using our system as well as a comparison to other freely available or open source systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A contact interaction is proposed to exist between the voltage sensor of the transverse tubular membrane of skeletal muscle and the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is given a quantitative formulation inspired in the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model of allosteric transitions in hemoglobin (Monod, J., J. Wyman, and J.-P. Changeux. 1965. Journal of Molecular Biology. 12:88-118), and analogous to one proposed by Marks and Jones for voltage-dependent Ca channels (Marks, T. N., and S. W. Jones. 1992. Journal of General Physiology. 99:367-390). The allosteric protein is the calcium release channel, a homotetramer, with two accessible states, closed and open. The kinetics and equilibrium of this transition are modulated by voltage sensors (dihydropyridine receptors) pictured as four units per release channel, each undergoing independent voltage-driven transitions between two states (resting and activating). For each voltage sensor that moves to the activating state, the tendency of the channel to open increases by an equal (large) factor. The equilibrium and kinetic equations of the model are solved and shown to reproduce well a number of experimentally measured relationships including: charge movement (Q) vs. voltage, open probability of the release channel (Po) vs. voltage, the transfer function relationship Po vs. Q, and the kinetics of charge movement, release activation, and deactivation. The main consequence of the assumption of allosteric coupling is that primary effects on the release channel are transmitted backward to the voltage sensor and give secondary effects. Thus, the model reproduces well the effects of perchlorate, described in the two previous articles, under the assumption that the primary effect is to increase the intrinsic tendency of the release channel to open, with no direct effects on the voltage sensor. This modification of the open-closed equilibrium of the release channel causes a shift in the equilibrium dependency of charge movement with voltage. The paradoxical slowing of charge movement by perchlorate also results from reciprocal effects of the channel on the allosterically coupled voltage sensors. The observations of the previous articles plus the simulations in this article constitute functional evidence of allosteric transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {A relatively simple method is presented for incorporating cross-bridge mechanisms into a muscle model. The method is based on representing force in a half sarcomere as the product of the stiffness of all parallel cross bridges and their average distortion. Differential equations for sarcomeric stiffness are derived from a three-state kinetic scheme for the cross-bridge cycle. Differential equations for average distortion are derived from a distortional balance that accounts for distortion entering and leaving due to cross-bridge cycling and for distortion imposed by shearing motion between thick and thin filaments. The distortion equations are unique and enable sarcomere mechanodynamics to be described by only a few ordinary differential equations. Model predictions of small-amplitude step and sinusoidal responses agreed well with previously described experimental results and allowed unique interpretations to be made of various response components. Similarly good results were obtained for model reproductions of force-velocity and large-amplitude step and ramp responses. The model allowed reasonable predictions of contractile behavior by taking into account what is understood to be basic muscle contractile mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Current compression schemes for floating-point data commonly take fixed-precision values and compress them to a variable-length bit stream, complicating memory management and random access. We present a fixed-rate, near-lossless compression scheme that maps small blocks of \$4{\textasciicircum}d\$ values in \$d\$ dimensions to a fixed, user-specified number of bits per block, thereby allowing read and write random access to compressed floating-point data at block granularity. Our approach is inspired by fixed-rate texture compression methods widely adopted in graphics hardware, but has been tailored to the high dynamic range and precision demands of scientific applications. Our compressor is based on a new, lifted, orthogonal block transform and embedded coding, allowing each per-block bit stream to be truncated at any point if desired, thus facilitating bit rate selection using a single compression scheme. To avoid compression or decompression upon every data access, we employ a software write-back cache of uncompressed blocks. Our compressor has been designed with computational simplicity and speed in mind to allow for the possibility of a hardware implementation, and uses only a small number of fixed-point arithmetic operations per compressed value. We demonstrate the viability and benefits of lossy compression in several applications, including visualization, quantitative data analysis, and numerical simulation.},

We employ a new data structure adapted from the original balanced k-d tree, which allows for representation of data with trivial or no overhead. In the OSPRay visualization framework, we have developed an efficient CPU algorithm for traversing, classifying and ray tracing these data. Our approach is able to render up to billions of particles on a typical workstation, purely on the CPU, without any approximations or level-of-detail techniques, and optionally with attribute-based color mapping, dynamic range query, and advanced lighting models such as ambient occlusion and path tracing.},

Here, a model is presented which consists of four elements: a contractile element with force–length and force–velocity relations for concentric and eccentric contractions, a parallel elastic element, a series elastic element, and a serial damping element. With this, it combines previously published effects relevant for muscular contraction, i.e. serial damping and eccentric force–velocity relation. The model is exemplarily applied to arm movements. The more realistic representation of the eccentric force–velocity relation results in human-like elbow-joint flexion. The model is provided as ready to use Matlab ® and Simulink ® code."

  abstract = {Several types of equilibrium point (EP) controllers have been proposed for the control of posture and movement. EP controllers are appealing from a computational perspective because they do not require solving the “inverse dynamic problem” (i.e., computation of the torques required to move a system along a desired trajectory). It has been argued that EP controllers are not capable of controlling fast single-joint movements. To refute this statement, several extensions have been proposed, although these have been tested using models in which only the tendon compliance, force–length–velocity relation, and mechanical interaction between tendon and contractile element were not adequately represented. In the present study, fast elbow-joint movements were measured and an attempt was made to reproduce these using a realistic musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Three types of EP controllers were evaluated: an open-loop α-controller, a closed-loop λ-controller, and a hybrid open- and closed-loop controller. For each controller we considered a continuous version and a version in which the control signals were sent out intermittently. Only the intermittent hybrid EP controller was capable of generating movements that were as fast as those of the subjects. As a result of the nonlinear muscle properties, the hybrid EP controller requires a more detailed representation of static muscle properties than generally assumed in the context of EP control. In sum, this study shows that fast single-joint movements can be realized without explicitly solving the inverse dynamics problem, but in a less straightforward manner than implied by proponents of conventional EP controllers.},

We measured oscillations in experiments with several species (Rattus norvegicus, Galea musteloides, Rana pipiens) and different experimental setups. These oscillations are generally ignored as artifacts. This study investigates the cause of the oscillations. A biomechanical model of the experimental setup was developed consisting of a geometric model describing the setup and a Hill-type muscle-tendon model including the force-length-velocity relation and a linear spring in series. Muscle properties of each muscle were determined by the ISOFIT method. Model calculations and forward simulations of quick-release experiments based on experimentally determined muscle properties reveal that the observed oscillations are not artifacts (instrument and control), but the result of interactions of muscle-tendon properties with the inertia of muscles, bones and lever system.},

  abstract={Explosive movements such as throwing, kicking, and jumping are characterized by high velocity and short movement time. Due to the fact that latencies of neural feedback loops are long in comparison to movement times, correction of deviations cannot be achieved on the basis of neural feedback. In other words, the control signals must be largely preprogrammed. Furthermore, in many explosive movements the skeletal system is mechanically analogous to an inverted pendulum; in such a system, disturbances tend to be amplified as time proceeds. It is difficult to understand how an inverted-pendulum-like system can be controlled on the basis of some form of open loop control (albeit during a finite period of time only). To investigate if actuator properties, specifically the force-length-velocity relationship of muscle, reduce the control problem associated with explosive movement tasks such as human vertical jumping, a direct dynamics modeling and simulation approach was adopted. In order to identify the role of muscle properties, two types of open loop control signals were applied: STIM(t), representing the stimulation of muscles, and MOM(t), representing net joint moments. In case of STIM control, muscle properties influence the joint moments exerted on the skeleton; in case of MOM control, these moments are directly prescribed. By applying perturbations and comparing the deviations from a reference movement for both types of control, the reduction of the effect of disturbances due to muscle properties was calculated. It was found that the system is very sensitive to perturbations in case of MOM control; the sensitivity to perturbations is markedly less in case of STIM control. It was concluded that muscle properties constitute a peripheral feedback system that has the advantage of zero time delay. This feedback system reduces the effect of perturbations during human vertical jumping to such a degree that when perturbations are not too large, the task may be performed successfully without any adaptation of the muscle stimulation pattern.},

In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance. The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity (EMG). Two types of models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models performance, was the flexion–extension movement of the forearm with a hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized neural activation levels of the four main flexor–extensor muscles of the elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model, although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed."

First, we apply an inverse kinematics algorithm to obtain joint angles from markers positions; next we compute an inverse dynamics algorithm to obtain joint torques with a generic dynamical model of human arm designed by using Matlab-Simulink Simmechanics. Those torques are used in an optimization algorithm under non-linear constraints in order to compute muscle forces. The main part of the article presents the contributions of these constraints to build an adequate cost function. We propose to improve the method with the addition of a unilateral constraint that deals with the co-contraction of the muscle. We discuss results that emphasize the interest of taking the co-contraction into account by presenting a compared analysis for an extension of the elbow. Then we focus on a solution based on interpolation into a pre-computed database. This proposition aims at improving the model to meet the real-time constraint imposed for use in virtual reality applications.},

  abstract={Muscle modelling is an important component of body segmental motion analysis. Although many studies had focused on static conditions the relationship between electromyographic (EMG) signals and joint torque under voluntary dynamic situations has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) under voluntary dynamic situations for torque estimation of the elbow complex. EMG signals together with kinematic data, which included angle and angular velocity, were used as the inputs to estimate the expected torque during movement. Moreover, the roles of angle and angular velocity in the accuracy of prediction were investigated, and two models were compared. One model used EMG and joint kinematic inputs and the other model used only EMG inputs without kinematic data. Six healthy subjects were recruited, and two average angular velocities (60o s−1 and 90o s−1) with three different loads (0 kg, 1 kg, 2 kg) in the hand position were selected to train and test the RANN between 90o elbow flexion and full elbow extension (0o). After training, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with EMG and joint kinematic inputs in the training data set and the test data set were 0.17{\textpm}0.03 Nm and 0.35{\textpm}0.06 Nm, respectively. The RMSE values between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with only EMG inputs in the training data set and the test set, were 0.57{\textpm}0.07 Nm and 0.73{\textpm}0.11 Nm, respectively. The results showed that EMG signals together with kinematic data gave significantly better performance in the joint torque prediction; joint angle and angular velocity provided important information in the estimation of joint torque in voluntary dynamic movement.},

Muscle–tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and low-pass filtered EMG as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active FE in an isokinetic dynamometer, running, and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the FE moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average R2 of 0.91 and mean residual error of ∼12Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed FE moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks."

  abstract = {SUMMARYA new method for the estimation of subject-specific muscle–tendon parameters of the knee actuators based on dynamometry experiments is presented. The algorithm aims at estimating the tendon slack length and the optimal muscle fiber length by minimizing the difference between experimentally reproduced and model-based joint moments. The key innovative features are as follows: (i) the inclusion of a priori physiological knowledge to define a physiologically feasible set, the hot start for the optimization, and constraints for the optimization and (ii) the introduction of a new (affine) transformation of the muscle–tendon parameters, which greatly improves the numerical condition of the optimization.The influence of the initial guess and of measurement noise was studied in a simulation environment, and the performance was compared with that of the method presented earlier by Garner and Pandy for the upper limb. The tendon slack length was estimated for 97.5/63\% (extensors/flexors) of all initial guesses within 2\% of the ground truth. The optimal fiber length was estimated for 89/90\% (extensors/flexors) of all initial guesses within 2\% of the ground truth. When 10 Nm measurement noise was added, the mean value of the estimated tendon slack length deviated at most 1.9/1.6\% (extensors/flexors) from the ground truth whereas the standard deviations were at most 5.1/3.9\%. The mean value of the estimated optimal fiber length deviated at most 4.3/3.0\% (extensors/flexors) from the ground truth whereas the standard deviations were at most 10.2/15.5\%. In comparison, mean values resulting from the method of Garner and Pandy deviated up to 181\% ( ± 123\%) and 119\% ( ± 30\%) from the ground truth for, respectively, optimal fiber length and tendon slack length of rectus femoris.We concluded that the presented method had a low dependency on the initial guess and outperformed the method of Garner and Pandy in terms of accuracy by at least one order of magnitude when parameters were estimated from noisy data. The improvements open new perspectives for subject-specific modelling of muscles and tendons, which is beneficial for the accuracy of human motion simulations.

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a general method for estimating the architectural properties of human muscles in vivo. The method consists of a two-phase, nested optimization procedure in which the values of peak isometric force, optimal muscle-fiber length, and tendon slack length are calculated for each musculotendon actuator, knowing muscle volume and the minimum and maximum physiological lengths of the actuator. In phase I, the positions of the bones and the activation levels of the muscles are found by maximizing the isometric torque developed for each degree of freedom at each joint. In phase II, the architectural properties of each musculotendon actuator are found by matching the strength profile of the model to that measured for subjects. The method is used to estimate the architectural properties of 26 major muscle groups crossing the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Wherever possible, the model calculations are compared against measurements obtained from anatomical studies reported in the literature.

We then developed a novel and comprehensive EMG-driven model of the human lower extremity that used EMG signals from 16 muscle groups to drive 34 MTUs and satisfy the resulting joint moments simultaneously produced about four DOFs during different motor tasks. This also led to the development of a calibration procedure that allowed identifying a set of subject-specific parameters that ensured physiological behavior for the 34 MTUs. Results showed that currently available single-DOF models did not provide the same unique MTU force solution for the same input data. On the other hand, the MTU force solution predicted by our proposed multi-DOF model satisfied joint moments about multiple DOFs without loss of accuracy compared to single-DOF models corresponding to each of the four DOFs. The predicted MTU force solution was (1) a function of experimentally measured EMGs, (2) the result of physiological MTU excitation, (3) reflected different MTU contraction strategies associated to different motor tasks, (4) coordinated a greater number of MTUs with respect to currently available single-DOF models, and (5) was not specific to an individual DOF dynamics. Therefore, our proposed methodology has the potential of producing a more dynamically consistent and generalizable MTU force solution than was possible using single-DOF EMG-driven models. This will help better address the important scientific questions previously approached using single-DOF EMG-driven modeling. Furthermore, it might have applications in the development of human-machine interfaces for assistive devices.},

  abstract={Neurological impairments such as stroke cause damage to the functional mobility of survivors and affect their ability to perform activities of daily living. Recently, robotic treatment for upper limb stroke rehabilitation has received significant attention because it can provide high-intensity and repetitive movement therapy. In this review, the current status of upper limb rehabilitation robots is explored. Firstly, an overview of mechanical design of robotics for upper-limb rehabilitation and clinical effects of part robots are provided. Then, the comparisons of human-machine interactions, control strategies, driving modes, and training modes are described. Finally, the development and the possible future directions of the upper limb rehabilitation robot are discussed.},

  abstract="Subject-specific models of the musculoskeletal system are capable of accurately estimating function and loads and show promise for clinical use. However, creating subject-specific models is time-consuming and requires high levels of expertise. To address these issues, we have developed the open source Musculoskeletal Atlas Project (MAP) Client software. The MAP Client provides a user-friendly interface for creating musculoskeletal modelling workflows using community-created plug-ins. In this paper, we discuss the design of the MAP Client, its plug-in architecture and its integration with the Physiome Model Repository. We demonstrate the use of MAP Client with a subject-specific femur modelling workflow using a set of modular open source plug-ins for image segmentation, landmark prediction, model registration and customisation. Our long-term goal is to foster a community of MAP users and plug-in developers to accelerate the clinical use of computational models.",

abstract = "Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating unstructured meshes of triangles for use in interpolation, the finite element method, and the finite volume method. In theory and practice, meshes produced by Delaunay refinement satisfy guaranteed bounds on angles, edge lengths, the number of triangles, and the grading of triangles from small to large sizes. This article presents an intuitive framework for analyzing Delaunay refinement algorithms that unifies the pioneering mesh generation algorithms of L. Paul Chew and Jim Ruppert, improves the algorithms in several minor ways, and most importantly, helps to solve the difficult problem of meshing nonmanifold domains with small angles. Although small angles inherent in the input geometry cannot be removed, one would like to triangulate a domain without creating any new small angles. Unfortunately, this problem is not always soluble. A compromise is necessary. A Delaunay refinement algorithm is presented that can create a mesh in which most angles are 30° or greater and no angle is smaller than arcsin[(3/2)sin(φ/2)]∼(3/4)φ, where φ⩽60°is the smallest angle separating two segments of the input domain. New angles smaller than 30° appear only near input angles smaller than 60°. In practice, the algorithm's performance is better than these bounds suggest. Another new result is that Ruppert's analysis technique can be used to reanalyze one of Chew's algorithms. Chew proved that his algorithm produces no angle smaller than 30° (barring small input angles), but without any guarantees on grading or number of triangles. He conjectures that his algorithm offers such guarantees. His conjecture is conditionally confirmed here: if the angle bound is relaxed to less than 26.5°, Chew's algorithm produces meshes (of domains without small input angles) that are nicely graded and size-optimal."

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

  abstract={Determination of skeletal muscle architecture is important for accurately modeling muscle behavior. Current methods for 3D muscle architecture determination can be costly and time-consuming, making them prohibitive for clinical or modeling applications. Computational approaches such as Laplacian flow simulations can estimate muscle fascicle orientation based on muscle shape and aponeurosis location. The accuracy of this approach is unknown, however, since it has not been validated against other standards for muscle architecture determination. In this study, muscle architectures from the Laplacian approach were compared to those determined from diffusion tensor imaging in eight adult medial gastrocnemius muscles. The datasets were subdivided into training and validation sets, and computational fluid dynamics software was used to conduct Laplacian simulations. In training sets, inputs of muscle geometry, aponeurosis location, and geometric flow guides resulted in good agreement between methods. Application of the method to validation sets showed no significant differences in pennation angle (mean difference {\$}{\$}0.5{\{}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\}}){\$}{\$}0.5∘)or fascicle length (mean difference 0.9 mm). Laplacian simulation was thus effective at predicting gastrocnemius muscle architectures in healthy volunteers using imaging-derived muscle shape and aponeurosis locations. This method may serve as a tool for determining muscle architecture in silico and as a complement to other approaches.},

Engng 2010; 83:403–425), it has been demonstrated that harmonic parametrizations can be used as input for surface meshers to produce high-quality triangulations. However, two important limitations were pointed out, namely surfaces with high genus and/or of large aspect ratio. This paper addresses those two issues. We first develop a multiscale version of the harmonic parametrization of (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2010; 83:403–425) and then combine it with a multilevel partitioning algorithm to come up with an automatic remeshing algorithm that overcomes the above-mentioned limitations of harmonic maps. The overall procedure is implemented in the open-source mesh generator Gmsh (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2009; 79(11): 1309–1331). Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To achieve both robustness and efficiency, we minimize a simple mesh-dependent energy through global updates of both vertex positions and connectivity. As this energy is known to be the ∠1 distance between an isotropic quadratic function and its linear interpolation on the mesh, our minimization procedure generates well-shaped tetrahedra. Mesh design is controlled through a gradation smoothness parameter and selection of the desired number of vertices. We provide the foundations of our approach by explaining both the underlying variational principle and its geometric interpretation. We demonstrate the quality of the resulting meshes through a series of examples.},

abstract = "Many physical phenomena in science and engineering can be modeled by partial differential equations and solved by means of the finite element method. Such a method uses as computational spatial support a mesh of the domain where the equations are formulated. The ‘mesh quality’ is a key-point for the accuracy of the numerical simulation. One can show that this quality is related to the shape and the size of the mesh elements. In the case where the element sizes are not specified in advance, a quality mesh is a regular mesh (whose elements are almost equilateral). This problem is a particular case of a more general mesh generation problem whose purpose is to construct meshes conforming to a prespecified isotropic size field associated with the computational domain. Such meshes can be seen as ‘unit meshes’ (whose elements are of unit size) in an appropriate non-Euclidean metric. In this case, a quality mesh of the domain is a unit mesh as regular as possible. In this paper, we are concerned with the generation of such a mesh and we propose a method to achieve this goal. First, the boundary of the domain is meshed using an indirect scheme via parametric domains and then the mesh of the three-dimensional (3D) domain is generated. In both cases, an empty mesh is first constructed, then enriched by field points, and finally optimized. The field points are defined following an algebraic or an advancing-front approach and are connected using a generalized Delaunay type method. To show the overall meshing process, we give an example of a 3D domain encountered in a classical computational fluid dynamics problem."

abstract = {CGALmesh is the mesh generation software package of the Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (CGAL). It generates isotropic simplicial meshes—surface triangular meshes or volume tetrahedral meshes—from input surfaces, 3D domains, and 3D multidomains, with or without sharp features. The underlying meshing algorithm relies on restricted Delaunay triangulations to approximate domains and surfaces and on Delaunay refinement to ensure both approximation accuracy and mesh quality. CGALmesh provides guarantees on approximation quality and on the size and shape of the mesh elements. It provides four optional mesh optimization algorithms to further improve the mesh quality. A distinctive property of CGALmesh is its high flexibility with respect to the input domain representation. Such a flexibility is achieved through a careful software design, gathering into a single abstract concept, denoted by the oracle, all required interface features between the meshing engine and the input domain. We already provide oracles for domains defined by polyhedral and implicit surfaces.},

Unlike the multitude of approaches for quad-remeshing of existing surfaces, we rely solely on the input curves to both conceive and construct the quad-mesh of an artist imagined surface bounded by them. We observe that viewers complete the intended shape by envisioning a dense network of smooth, gradually changing, flow-lines that interpolates the input curves. Components of the network bridge pairs of input curve segments with similar orientation and shape. Our algorithm mimics this behavior. It first segments the input closed curves into pairs of matching segments, defining dominant flow line sequences across the surface. It then interpolates the input curves by a network of quadrilateral cycles whose iso-lines define the desired flow line network. We proceed to interpolate these networks with all-quad meshes that convey designer intent. We evaluate our results by showing convincing quadrangulations of complex and diverse curve networks with concave, non-planar cycles, and validate our approach by comparing our results to artist generated interpolating meshes.},

By exploring the correspondence among shapes within a collection, we coherently extract a set of representative feature lines as the key characteristics for the given shapes. Then we compute a smooth cross-field interpolating sparsely distributed directional constraints induced from the feature lines and apply the mixed-integer quadrangulation to generate the quad meshes. We develop a greedy algorithm to extract aligned cut graphs across the shape collection so that the meshes can be aligned in a common parametric domain. Computational results demonstrate that our approach not only produces consistent quad meshes across the entire collection with significant geometry variation but also achieves a trade-off between global structural simplicity for the collection and local geometry fidelity for each shape."

A number of techniques use the harmonic parameterization to keep quads close to squares, or fit parametrization gradients to align quads to features. Both types of techniques create near-isotropic quads; feature-aligned quadrangulation algorithms reduce the remeshing error by aligning isotropic quads with principal curvature directions. A complementary approach is to allow for anisotropic elements, which are well-known to have significantly better approximation quality. In this work we present a simple and efficient technique to add curvature-dependent anisotropy to harmonic and feature-aligned parameterization and improve the approximation error of the quadrangulations. We use a metric derived from the shape operator which results in a more uniform error distribution, decreasing the error near features."

The method is based on the assumption that each directional velocity component varies linearly within a grid cell in its own coordinate directions. This assumption allows an analytical expression to be obtained describing the flow path within an individual grid cell. Given the initial position of a particle anywhere in a cell, the coordinates of any other point along its path line within the cell, and the time of travel between them, can be computed directly. For steady-state systems, the exit point for a particle entering a cell at any arbitrary location can be computed in a single step. By following the particle as it moves from cell to cell, this method can be used to trace the path of a particle through any multidimensional flow field generated from a block-centered finite-difference flow model.},

abstract = "Streamline methods have shown to be effective for reservoir simulation. For a regular grid, it is common to use the semi-analytical Pollock’s method to obtain streamlines and time-of-flight coordinates (TOF). The usual way of handling irregular grids is by trilinear transformation of each grid cell to a unit cube together with a linear flux interpolation scaled by the Jacobian. The flux interpolation allows for fast integration of streamlines, but is inaccurate even for uniform flow. To improve the tracing accuracy, we introduce a new interpolation method, which we call corner-velocity interpolation. Instead of interpolating the velocity field based on discrete fluxes at cell edges, the new method interpolates directly from reconstructed point velocities given at the corner points in the grid. This allows for reproduction of uniform flow, and eliminates the influence of cell geometries on the velocity field. Using several numerical examples, we demonstrate that the new method is more accurate than the standard tracing methods."

This trade-off is in part due to the lack of explicit modelling of muscle fibres (MFs). As a consequence, the organisation of MFs into motor-unit territories (MUTs) is particularly challenging. The current paper presents a possible technique to adress this issue by assigning MUTs in a homogenised sense in terms of muscle volume to FE skeletal muscle models. This method allows control of inter-MUT distance, the amount of intermingling between MUTs and the order of MUT assignment. It was found that both assigning smaller MUTs first and allowing a moderate amount of intermingling significantly influence MUT distributions. This technique allows a simplified and straight-forward way to introduce MUTs into 3D FE skeletal muscle models.},

The contractile properties of human motor units from the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the hand were studied during voluntary isometric contractions using recently developed techniques.2. The twitch tensions produced by motor units varied widely from about 0.1-10 g. The twitch tension of a motor unit varied nearly linearly as a function of the level of voluntary force at which it was recruited over the entire range of forces studied (0-2 kg).3. The number of additional motor units recruited during a given increment in force declined sharply at high levels of voluntary force. This suggests that even though the high threshold units generate more tension, the contribution of recruitment to increases in voluntary force declines at higher force levels.4. Contraction times for these motor units varied from 30 to 100 msec. Over 80{\%} had contraction times less than 70 msec, and might be classed as fast twitch motor units. The larger motor units, which were recruited at higher threshold forces, tended to have shorter contraction times than the smaller units.},

Force components of thumb abduction and flexion were measured before and after tetanic stimulation. The magnitude, direction, and time derivatives of resultant forces, together with axon conduction velocities, were calculated for each unit. 2. Various indexes of contraction and relaxation rate were measured including contraction time (time from force onset to peak), one-half relaxation time (time from peak force to one-half that value), normalized maximum contraction and normalized maximum relaxation rates (peak positive and negative time derivatives of the force signal normalized to twitch force), and the times at which these maximum rates occurred. 3. For different units, the directions of resultant forces were approximately evenly distributed between thumb abduction and flexion. At the onset of the experiment, initial twitch forces ranged from 3 to 34 mN, contraction times from 35 to 80 ms, and one-half relaxation times from 25 to 108 ms. 4. Resultant twitch forces were positively correlated to normalized maximum relaxation rates, but not to other rate indexes or to conduction velocity. The various contraction rate measures were correlated to each other, but generally not to relaxation rates. 5. After the first test involving tetanic stimulation, the twitches of most units were potentiated and slowed, especially their relaxation phase. However, the extent of these changes varied considerably between units. In general, units with weak initial forces potentiated most, some up to three-fold. These changes in twitch properties were denoted posttetanic twitch potentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) }

We suggest that if more data were available on these issues, the understanding of neuromuscular function would be enhanced substantially, especially with regard to plasticity in the motor neuron pool, adequacy of the neural drive to muscle, and flexibility of activation patterns across various types of contractions.

abstract={Electromyography (EMG) can be used to study the behaviour of the motor neurons and thus provides insights into the physiology of the central nervous system. However, due to the high complexity of neuromuscular control, EMG signals are challenging to interpret. While the exact knowledge of the excitation patterns of a specific muscle within an in vivo experimental setting remains elusive, simulations allow to systematically investigate EMG signals in a controlled environment. Within this context, simulations can provide virtual EMG data, which, for example, can be used to validate and optimise signal analysis methods that aim to estimate the relationship between EMG signals and the output of motor neuron pools. However, since existing methods, which are employed to compute EMG signals, exhibit deficiencies with respect to the physical model itself as well as with respect to numerical aspects, we propose a novel homogenised continuum model that closely resolves the electro-physiological behaviour of skeletal muscle tissue. The proposed model is based on an extension of the well-established bidomain model and includes a biophysically detailed description of the electrical activity within the tissue, which is due to the depolarisation of the muscle fibre membranes. In contrast to all other published EMG models, which assume that the electrical potential field for each muscle fibre can be calculated independently, the proposed model assumes that the electrical potential in the muscle fibres is coupled to the electrical potential in the extracellular space. We show that the newly proposed model is able to simulate realistic EMG signals and demonstrate the potential to employ the predicted virtual EMG signal in order to evaluate the goodness of automated decomposition algorithms.},

Customisation methods are also presented to morph generic models into subject-specific representations. Thirdly, population based modelling and statistical shape analysis methods are presented as efficient techniques that harness the power of big data and imaging databases. These allow prediction of human anatomy from minimal geometric information. Fourthly, a specific example of our framework is presented in the context of a validated orthopaedic clinical tool used for assessing osteolytic defects around implants. Finally, EMG-informed muscle modelling is presented combined with medical imaging to better understand musculoskeletal injury. The problem of NaF PET CT is used to highlight the problem of patellofemoral pain.",

    abstract = { Muscle fiber numbers were estimated in vivo in biceps brachii in 5 elite male bodybuilders, 7 intermediate caliber bodybuilders, and 13 age-matched controls. Mean fiber area and collagen volume density were calculated from needle biopsies and muscle cross-sectional area by computerized tomographic scanning. Contralateral measurements in a subsample of seven subjects indicated the method for estimation of fiber numbers to have adequate reliability. There was a wide interindividual range for fiber numbers in biceps (172,085–418,884), but despite large differences in muscle size both bodybuilder groups possessed the same number of muscle fibers as the group of untrained controls. Although there was a high correlation between average cross-sectional fiber area and total muscle cross-sectional area within each group, many of the subjects with the largest muscles also tended to have a large number of fibers. Since there were equally well-trained subjects with fewer than normal fiber numbers, we interpret this finding to be due to genetic endowment rather than to training-induced hyperplasia. The proportion of muscle comprised of connective and other noncontractile tissue was the same for all subjects (approximately 13\%), thus indicating greater absolute amounts of connective tissue in the trained subjects. We conclude that in humans, heavy resistance training directed toward achieving maximum size in skeletal muscle does not result in an increase in fiber numbers. }

abstract = {Matrices coming from elliptic Partial Differential Equations have been shown to have a low-rank property that can be efficiently exploited in multifrontal solvers to provide a substantial reduction of their complexity. Among the possible low-rank formats, the Block Low-Rank format (BLR) is easy to use in a general purpose multifrontal solver and its potential compared to standard (full-rank) solvers has been demonstrated. Recently, new variants have been introduced and it was proved that they can further reduce the complexity but their performance has never been analyzed. In this article, we present a multithreaded BLR factorization and analyze its efficiency and scalability in shared-memory multicore environments. We identify the challenges posed by the use of BLR approximations in multifrontal solvers and put forward several algorithmic variants of the BLR factorization that overcome these challenges by improving its efficiency and scalability. We illustrate the performance analysis of the BLR multifrontal factorization with numerical experiments on a large set of problems coming from a variety of real-life applications.},

abstract = {SUMMARY It is an established trend that CPU development takes advantage of Moore's Law to improve in parallelism much more than in scalar execution speed. This results in higher hardware thread counts (MIMD) and improved vector units (SIMD), of which the MIMD developments have received the focus of library research and development in recent years. To make use of the latest hardware improvements, SIMD must receive a stronger focus of API research and development because the computational power can no longer be neglected and often auto-vectorizing compilers cannot generate the necessary SIMD code, as will be shown in this paper. Nowadays, the SIMD capabilities are sufficiently significant to warrant vectorization of algorithms requiring more conditional execution than was originally expected for Streaming SIMD Extension to handle. The Vc library (http://compeng.uni-frankfurt.de/?vc) was designed to support developers in the creation of portable vectorized code. Its capabilities and performance have been thoroughly tested. Vc provides portability of the source code, allowing full utilization of the hardware's SIMD capabilities, without introducing any overhead. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
