  Abstract                 = {The ability for muscle to repeatedly generate force is limited by fatigue. The cellular mechanisms behind muscle fatigue are complex and potentially include breakdown at many points along the excitation–contraction pathway. In this paper we construct a mathematical model of the skeletal muscle excitation–contraction pathway based on the cellular biochemical events that link excitation to contraction. The model includes descriptions of membrane voltage, calcium cycling and crossbridge dynamics and was parameterised and validated using the response characteristics of mouse skeletal muscle to a range of electrical stimuli. This model was used to uncover the complexities of skeletal muscle fatigue. We also parameterised our model to describe force kinetics in fast and slow twitch fibre types, which have a number of biochemical and biophysical differences. How these differences interact to generate different force/fatigue responses in fast- and slow- twitch fibres is not well understood and we used our modelling approach to bring new insights to this relationship.},

Traditional rasterization-based visualization approaches encounter performance and quality limitations, particularly in HPC environments without dedicated rendering hardware. In this paper, we present OSPRay, a turn-key CPU ray tracing framework oriented towards production-use scientific visualization which can utilize varying SIMD widths and multiple device backends found across diverse HPC resources. This framework provides a high-quality, efficient CPU-based solution for typical visualization workloads, which has already been integrated into several prevalent visualization packages. We show that this system delivers the performance, high-level API simplicity, and modular device support needed to provide a compelling new rendering framework for implementing efficient scientific visualization workflows.},

	abstract = {Visualization applications nowadays not only face increasingly larger datasets, but have to solve increasingly complex research questions. They often require more than a single algorithm and consequently a software solution will exceed the possibilities of simple research prototypes. Well-established systems intended for such complex visual analysis purposes have usually been designed for classical, mesh-based graphics approaches. For particle-based data, however, existing visualization frameworks are too generic - e.g. lacking possibilities for consistent low-level GPU optimization for high-performance graphics - and at the same time are too limited - e.g. by enforcing the use of structures suboptimal for some computations. Thus, we developed the system softwareMegaMol for visualization research on particle-based data. On the one hand, flexible data structures and functional module design allow for easy adaption to changing research questions, e.g. studying vapors in thermodynamics, solid material in physics, or complex functional macromolecules like proteins in biochemistry. Therefore, MegaMol is designed as a development framework. On the other hand, common functionality for data handling and advanced rendering implementations are available and beneficial for all applications. We present several case studies of work implemented using our system as well as a comparison to other freely available or open source systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A contact interaction is proposed to exist between the voltage sensor of the transverse tubular membrane of skeletal muscle and the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is given a quantitative formulation inspired in the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model of allosteric transitions in hemoglobin (Monod, J., J. Wyman, and J.-P. Changeux. 1965. Journal of Molecular Biology. 12:88-118), and analogous to one proposed by Marks and Jones for voltage-dependent Ca channels (Marks, T. N., and S. W. Jones. 1992. Journal of General Physiology. 99:367-390). The allosteric protein is the calcium release channel, a homotetramer, with two accessible states, closed and open. The kinetics and equilibrium of this transition are modulated by voltage sensors (dihydropyridine receptors) pictured as four units per release channel, each undergoing independent voltage-driven transitions between two states (resting and activating). For each voltage sensor that moves to the activating state, the tendency of the channel to open increases by an equal (large) factor. The equilibrium and kinetic equations of the model are solved and shown to reproduce well a number of experimentally measured relationships including: charge movement (Q) vs. voltage, open probability of the release channel (Po) vs. voltage, the transfer function relationship Po vs. Q, and the kinetics of charge movement, release activation, and deactivation. The main consequence of the assumption of allosteric coupling is that primary effects on the release channel are transmitted backward to the voltage sensor and give secondary effects. Thus, the model reproduces well the effects of perchlorate, described in the two previous articles, under the assumption that the primary effect is to increase the intrinsic tendency of the release channel to open, with no direct effects on the voltage sensor. This modification of the open-closed equilibrium of the release channel causes a shift in the equilibrium dependency of charge movement with voltage. The paradoxical slowing of charge movement by perchlorate also results from reciprocal effects of the channel on the allosterically coupled voltage sensors. The observations of the previous articles plus the simulations in this article constitute functional evidence of allosteric transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {A relatively simple method is presented for incorporating cross-bridge mechanisms into a muscle model. The method is based on representing force in a half sarcomere as the product of the stiffness of all parallel cross bridges and their average distortion. Differential equations for sarcomeric stiffness are derived from a three-state kinetic scheme for the cross-bridge cycle. Differential equations for average distortion are derived from a distortional balance that accounts for distortion entering and leaving due to cross-bridge cycling and for distortion imposed by shearing motion between thick and thin filaments. The distortion equations are unique and enable sarcomere mechanodynamics to be described by only a few ordinary differential equations. Model predictions of small-amplitude step and sinusoidal responses agreed well with previously described experimental results and allowed unique interpretations to be made of various response components. Similarly good results were obtained for model reproductions of force-velocity and large-amplitude step and ramp responses. The model allowed reasonable predictions of contractile behavior by taking into account what is understood to be basic muscle contractile mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Current compression schemes for floating-point data commonly take fixed-precision values and compress them to a variable-length bit stream, complicating memory management and random access. We present a fixed-rate, near-lossless compression scheme that maps small blocks of \$4{\textasciicircum}d\$ values in \$d\$ dimensions to a fixed, user-specified number of bits per block, thereby allowing read and write random access to compressed floating-point data at block granularity. Our approach is inspired by fixed-rate texture compression methods widely adopted in graphics hardware, but has been tailored to the high dynamic range and precision demands of scientific applications. Our compressor is based on a new, lifted, orthogonal block transform and embedded coding, allowing each per-block bit stream to be truncated at any point if desired, thus facilitating bit rate selection using a single compression scheme. To avoid compression or decompression upon every data access, we employ a software write-back cache of uncompressed blocks. Our compressor has been designed with computational simplicity and speed in mind to allow for the possibility of a hardware implementation, and uses only a small number of fixed-point arithmetic operations per compressed value. We demonstrate the viability and benefits of lossy compression in several applications, including visualization, quantitative data analysis, and numerical simulation.},

We employ a new data structure adapted from the original balanced k-d tree, which allows for representation of data with trivial or no overhead. In the OSPRay visualization framework, we have developed an efficient CPU algorithm for traversing, classifying and ray tracing these data. Our approach is able to render up to billions of particles on a typical workstation, purely on the CPU, without any approximations or level-of-detail techniques, and optionally with attribute-based color mapping, dynamic range query, and advanced lighting models such as ambient occlusion and path tracing.},

Here, a model is presented which consists of four elements: a contractile element with force–length and force–velocity relations for concentric and eccentric contractions, a parallel elastic element, a series elastic element, and a serial damping element. With this, it combines previously published effects relevant for muscular contraction, i.e. serial damping and eccentric force–velocity relation. The model is exemplarily applied to arm movements. The more realistic representation of the eccentric force–velocity relation results in human-like elbow-joint flexion. The model is provided as ready to use Matlab ® and Simulink ® code."

Therefore, former studies proposed that protective damping might be explained by modelling the contractile machinery of the muscles in more detail, i.e., taking the microscopic processes of the actin--myosin coupling into account. In contrast, this study formulates an alternative hypothesis: low but significant damping of the passive material in series to the contractile machinery---e.g., tendons, aponeuroses, titin---may well suffice to damp these hazardous vibrations. Thereto, we measured the contraction dynamics of a piglet muscle--tendon complex (MTC) in three contraction modes at varying loads and muscle--tendon lengths. We simulated all three respective load situations on a computer: a Hill-type muscle model including a contractile element (CE) and each an elastic element in parallel (PEE) and in series (SEE) to the CE pulled on a loading mass. By comparing the model to the measured output of the MTC, we extracted a consistent set of muscle parameters. We varied the model by introducing either linear damping in parallel or in series to the CE leading to accordant re-formulations of the contraction dynamics of the CE. The comparison of the three cases (no additional damping, parallel damping, serial damping) revealed that serial damping at a physiological magnitude suffices to explain damping of high-frequency vibrations of low amplitudes. The simulation demonstrates that any undamped serial structure within the MTC enforces SEE-load eigenoscillations. Consequently, damping must be spread all over the MTC, i.e., rather has to be de-localised than localised within just the active muscle material. Additionally, due to suppressed eigenoscillations Hill-type muscle models taking into account serial damping are numerically more efficient when used in macroscopic biomechanical neuro-musculo-skeletal models.},

  abstract = {Several types of equilibrium point (EP) controllers have been proposed for the control of posture and movement. EP controllers are appealing from a computational perspective because they do not require solving the “inverse dynamic problem” (i.e., computation of the torques required to move a system along a desired trajectory). It has been argued that EP controllers are not capable of controlling fast single-joint movements. To refute this statement, several extensions have been proposed, although these have been tested using models in which only the tendon compliance, force–length–velocity relation, and mechanical interaction between tendon and contractile element were not adequately represented. In the present study, fast elbow-joint movements were measured and an attempt was made to reproduce these using a realistic musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Three types of EP controllers were evaluated: an open-loop α-controller, a closed-loop λ-controller, and a hybrid open- and closed-loop controller. For each controller we considered a continuous version and a version in which the control signals were sent out intermittently. Only the intermittent hybrid EP controller was capable of generating movements that were as fast as those of the subjects. As a result of the nonlinear muscle properties, the hybrid EP controller requires a more detailed representation of static muscle properties than generally assumed in the context of EP control. In sum, this study shows that fast single-joint movements can be realized without explicitly solving the inverse dynamics problem, but in a less straightforward manner than implied by proponents of conventional EP controllers.},

  abstract={Compared to complex structural Huxley-type models, Hill-type models phenomenologically describe muscle contraction using only few state variables. The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve stimulation. Hill-type models containing force--length and force--velocity relationship, excitation--contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic force--elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible passive force, the force--velocity relation and the series elastic component relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC], these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling.},

  abstract={Explosive movements such as throwing, kicking, and jumping are characterized by high velocity and short movement time. Due to the fact that latencies of neural feedback loops are long in comparison to movement times, correction of deviations cannot be achieved on the basis of neural feedback. In other words, the control signals must be largely preprogrammed. Furthermore, in many explosive movements the skeletal system is mechanically analogous to an inverted pendulum; in such a system, disturbances tend to be amplified as time proceeds. It is difficult to understand how an inverted-pendulum-like system can be controlled on the basis of some form of open loop control (albeit during a finite period of time only). To investigate if actuator properties, specifically the force-length-velocity relationship of muscle, reduce the control problem associated with explosive movement tasks such as human vertical jumping, a direct dynamics modeling and simulation approach was adopted. In order to identify the role of muscle properties, two types of open loop control signals were applied: STIM(t), representing the stimulation of muscles, and MOM(t), representing net joint moments. In case of STIM control, muscle properties influence the joint moments exerted on the skeleton; in case of MOM control, these moments are directly prescribed. By applying perturbations and comparing the deviations from a reference movement for both types of control, the reduction of the effect of disturbances due to muscle properties was calculated. It was found that the system is very sensitive to perturbations in case of MOM control; the sensitivity to perturbations is markedly less in case of STIM control. It was concluded that muscle properties constitute a peripheral feedback system that has the advantage of zero time delay. This feedback system reduces the effect of perturbations during human vertical jumping to such a degree that when perturbations are not too large, the task may be performed successfully without any adaptation of the muscle stimulation pattern.},

In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance. The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity (EMG). Two types of models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models performance, was the flexion–extension movement of the forearm with a hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized neural activation levels of the four main flexor–extensor muscles of the elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model, although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed."

First, we apply an inverse kinematics algorithm to obtain joint angles from markers positions; next we compute an inverse dynamics algorithm to obtain joint torques with a generic dynamical model of human arm designed by using Matlab-Simulink Simmechanics. Those torques are used in an optimization algorithm under non-linear constraints in order to compute muscle forces. The main part of the article presents the contributions of these constraints to build an adequate cost function. We propose to improve the method with the addition of a unilateral constraint that deals with the co-contraction of the muscle. We discuss results that emphasize the interest of taking the co-contraction into account by presenting a compared analysis for an extension of the elbow. Then we focus on a solution based on interpolation into a pre-computed database. This proposition aims at improving the model to meet the real-time constraint imposed for use in virtual reality applications.},

Although many studies had focused on static conditions the relationship between electromyographic (EMG) signals and joint torque under voluntary dynamic situations has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) under voluntary dynamic situations for torque estimation of the elbow complex. EMG signals together with kinematic data, which included angle and angular velocity, were used as the inputs to estimate the expected torque during movement. Moreover, the roles of angle and angular velocity in the accuracy of prediction were investigated, and two models were compared. One model used EMG and joint kinematic inputs and the other model used only EMG inputs without kinematic data. Six healthy subjects were recruited, and two average angular velocities (60o s−1 and 90o s−1) with three different loads (0 kg, 1 kg, 2 kg) in the hand position were selected to train and test the RANN between 90o elbow flexion and full elbow extension (0o). After training, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with EMG and joint kinematic inputs in the training data set and the test data set were 0.17{\textpm}0.03 Nm and 0.35{\textpm}0.06 Nm, respectively. The RMSE values between expected torque and predicted torque of the model, with only EMG inputs in the training data set and the test set, were 0.57{\textpm}0.07 Nm and 0.73{\textpm}0.11 Nm, respectively. The results showed that EMG signals together with kinematic data gave significantly better performance in the joint torque prediction; joint angle and angular velocity provided important information in the estimation of joint torque in voluntary dynamic movement.},

Muscle–tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and low-pass filtered EMG as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active FE in an isokinetic dynamometer, running, and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the FE moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average R2 of 0.91 and mean residual error of ∼12Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed FE moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks."

  abstract = {SUMMARYA new method for the estimation of subject-specific muscle–tendon parameters of the knee actuators based on dynamometry experiments is presented. The algorithm aims at estimating the tendon slack length and the optimal muscle fiber length by minimizing the difference between experimentally reproduced and model-based joint moments. The key innovative features are as follows: (i) the inclusion of a priori physiological knowledge to define a physiologically feasible set, the hot start for the optimization, and constraints for the optimization and (ii) the introduction of a new (affine) transformation of the muscle–tendon parameters, which greatly improves the numerical condition of the optimization.The influence of the initial guess and of measurement noise was studied in a simulation environment, and the performance was compared with that of the method presented earlier by Garner and Pandy for the upper limb. The tendon slack length was estimated for 97.5/63\% (extensors/flexors) of all initial guesses within 2\% of the ground truth. The optimal fiber length was estimated for 89/90\% (extensors/flexors) of all initial guesses within 2\% of the ground truth. When 10 Nm measurement noise was added, the mean value of the estimated tendon slack length deviated at most 1.9/1.6\% (extensors/flexors) from the ground truth whereas the standard deviations were at most 5.1/3.9\%. The mean value of the estimated optimal fiber length deviated at most 4.3/3.0\% (extensors/flexors) from the ground truth whereas the standard deviations were at most 10.2/15.5\%. In comparison, mean values resulting from the method of Garner and Pandy deviated up to 181\% ( ± 123\%) and 119\% ( ± 30\%) from the ground truth for, respectively, optimal fiber length and tendon slack length of rectus femoris.We concluded that the presented method had a low dependency on the initial guess and outperformed the method of Garner and Pandy in terms of accuracy by at least one order of magnitude when parameters were estimated from noisy data. The improvements open new perspectives for subject-specific modelling of muscles and tendons, which is beneficial for the accuracy of human motion simulations.

The method consists of a two-phase, nested optimization procedure in which the values of peak isometric force, optimal muscle-fiber length, and tendon slack length are calculated for each musculotendon actuator, knowing muscle volume and the minimum and maximum physiological lengths of the actuator. In phase I, the positions of the bones and the activation levels of the muscles are found by maximizing the isometric torque developed for each degree of freedom at each joint. In phase II, the architectural properties of each musculotendon actuator are found by matching the strength profile of the model to that measured for subjects. The method is used to estimate the architectural properties of 26 major muscle groups crossing the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Wherever possible, the model calculations are compared against measurements obtained from anatomical studies reported in the literature.

    abstract = {This work examined if currently available electromyography (EMG) driven models, that are calibrated to satisfy joint moments about one single degree of freedom (DOF), could provide the same musculotendon unit (MTU) force solution, when driven by the same input data, but calibrated about a different DOF. We then developed a novel and comprehensive EMG-driven model of the human lower extremity that used EMG signals from 16 muscle groups to drive 34 MTUs and satisfy the resulting joint moments simultaneously produced about four DOFs during different motor tasks. This also led to the development of a calibration procedure that allowed identifying a set of subject-specific parameters that ensured physiological behavior for the 34 MTUs. Results showed that currently available single-DOF models did not provide the same unique MTU force solution for the same input data. On the other hand, the MTU force solution predicted by our proposed multi-DOF model satisfied joint moments about multiple DOFs without loss of accuracy compared to single-DOF models corresponding to each of the four DOFs. The predicted MTU force solution was (1) a function of experimentally measured EMGs, (2) the result of physiological MTU excitation, (3) reflected different MTU contraction strategies associated to different motor tasks, (4) coordinated a greater number of MTUs with respect to currently available single-DOF models, and (5) was not specific to an individual DOF dynamics. Therefore, our proposed methodology has the potential of producing a more dynamically consistent and generalizable MTU force solution than was possible using single-DOF EMG-driven models. This will help better address the important scientific questions previously approached using single-DOF EMG-driven modeling. Furthermore, it might have applications in the development of human-machine interfaces for assistive devices.},

Recently, robotic treatment for upper limb stroke rehabilitation has received significant attention because it can provide high-intensity and repetitive movement therapy. In this review, the current status of upper limb rehabilitation robots is explored. Firstly, an overview of mechanical design of robotics for upper-limb rehabilitation and clinical effects of part robots are provided. Then, the comparisons of human-machine interactions, control strategies, driving modes, and training modes are described. Finally, the development and the possible future directions of the upper limb rehabilitation robot are discussed.},

  abstract="Subject-specific models of the musculoskeletal system are capable of accurately estimating function and loads and show promise for clinical use. However, creating subject-specific models is time-consuming and requires high levels of expertise. To address these issues, we have developed the open source Musculoskeletal Atlas Project (MAP) Client software. The MAP Client provides a user-friendly interface for creating musculoskeletal modelling workflows using community-created plug-ins. In this paper, we discuss the design of the MAP Client, its plug-in architecture and its integration with the Physiome Model Repository. We demonstrate the use of MAP Client with a subject-specific femur modelling workflow using a set of modular open source plug-ins for image segmentation, landmark prediction, model registration and customisation. Our long-term goal is to foster a community of MAP users and plug-in developers to accelerate the clinical use of computational models.",

abstract = "Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating unstructured meshes of triangles for use in interpolation, the finite element method, and the finite volume method. In theory and practice, meshes produced by Delaunay refinement satisfy guaranteed bounds on angles, edge lengths, the number of triangles, and the grading of triangles from small to large sizes. This article presents an intuitive framework for analyzing Delaunay refinement algorithms that unifies the pioneering mesh generation algorithms of L. Paul Chew and Jim Ruppert, improves the algorithms in several minor ways, and most importantly, helps to solve the difficult problem of meshing nonmanifold domains with small angles. Although small angles inherent in the input geometry cannot be removed, one would like to triangulate a domain without creating any new small angles. Unfortunately, this problem is not always soluble. A compromise is necessary. A Delaunay refinement algorithm is presented that can create a mesh in which most angles are 30° or greater and no angle is smaller than arcsin[(3/2)sin(φ/2)]∼(3/4)φ, where φ⩽60°is the smallest angle separating two segments of the input domain. New angles smaller than 30° appear only near input angles smaller than 60°. In practice, the algorithm's performance is better than these bounds suggest. Another new result is that Ruppert's analysis technique can be used to reanalyze one of Chew's algorithms. Chew proved that his algorithm produces no angle smaller than 30° (barring small input angles), but without any guarantees on grading or number of triangles. He conjectures that his algorithm offers such guarantees. His conjecture is conditionally confirmed here: if the angle bound is relaxed to less than 26.5°, Chew's algorithm produces meshes (of domains without small input angles) that are nicely graded and size-optimal."

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

We show how to ensure a one-to-one mapping for the discrete harmonic map and introduce a cubic representation of the geometry based on curved PN triangles. Topological and geometrical limitations of harmonic maps are also put to the fore and discussed. We show that, with the proposed approach, we are able to recover high quality meshes from both low input STL triangulations and complex surfaces defined by many CAD patches.
